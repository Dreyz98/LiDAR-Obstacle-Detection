# 🚗 LiDAR-Based Obstacle Detection Simulator

This project simulates a simple 2D LiDAR scanner to detect obstacles in a grid-based environment. It replicates basic LiDAR behavior by casting virtual rays and computing distances to nearby objects, with real-time visualization.

Designed as a learning project for autonomous vehicle perception and robotics, it showcases concepts such as point cloud simulation, sensor modeling, and basic obstacle detection.
